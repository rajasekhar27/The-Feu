Having set up a now successful Bar, Kitchen and Dessert Bar - Feu, she longed to bring the true culinary experience to the city in the form of fine desserts, pan Asian, continental, dining. You can see the passion that goes into her work as she cares for every little detail from food to service and presentation. When you step into the rustic walls surrounded by nature in Feu, you know youâ€™re about to be taken on a journey."
